 abstract = {Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML (BSML) is a structured
parallel functional programming language. It extends
a functional programming language of the ML family
with a polymorphic data structure and a very small
set of primitives. In this paper we describe a
framework for reasoning about BSML programs using
the Coq interactive theorem prover and for
extracting actual parallel programs from
proofs. This framework is illustrated through a
simulation application based on heat equation.},

 abstract = {Program calculation, being a programming technique
that derives programs from specification by means of
formula manipulation, is a challenging activity. It
requires human insights and creativity, and needs
systems to help human to focus on clever parts of
the derivation by automating tedious ones and
verifying correctness of transformations. Different
from many existing systems, we show in this paper
that Coq, a popular theorem prover, provides a cheap
way to implement a powerful system to support
program calculation, which has not been recognized
so far. We design and implement a set of tactics for
the Coq proof assistant to help the user to derive
programs by program calculation and to write proofs
in calculational form. The use of these tactics is
demonstrated through program calculations in Coq
based on the theory of lists.  },

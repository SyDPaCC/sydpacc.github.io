 abstract = {The All Nearest Smaller Values (ANSV) problem is an
important problem for parallel programming as it can
be used to solve several problems and is one of the
phases of several other parallel algorithms. We
formally develop by construction a functional
parallel program for solving the ANSV problem using
the theory of Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)
homomorphisms within the Coq proof assistant. The
performances of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel ML
program obtained from Coq is compared to a version
derived without software support (pen-and-paper) and
implemented using the Orléans Skeleton Library
of algorithmic skeletons, and to a (unproved
correct) direct implementation of the BSP algorithm
of He and Huang.  },

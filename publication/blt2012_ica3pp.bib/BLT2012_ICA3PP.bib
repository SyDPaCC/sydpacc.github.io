 abstract = {To make parallel programming as widespread as
parallel architectures, more structured parallel
programming paradigms are necessary.  One of the
possible approaches are Algorithmic skeletons that
are abstract parallel patterns. They can be seen as
higher order functions implemented in
parallel. Algorithmic skeletons offer a simple
interface to the programmer without all the details
of parallel implementations as they abstract the
communications and the synchronisations of parallel
activities.  To write a parallel program, users have
to combine and compose the skeletons.  Orléans
Skeleton Library (OSL) is an efficient
meta-programmed C++ library of algorithmic skeletons
that manipulate distributed arrays.  A prototype
implementation of OSL exists as a library written
with the function parallel language Bulk Synchronous
Parallel ML. In this paper we are interested in
verifying the correctness of a subset of this
prototype implementation. To do so, we give a
functional specification (i.e. without the parallel
details) of a subset of OSL and we prove the
correctness of the BSML implementation with respect
to this functional specification, using the Coq
proof assistant. To illustrate how the user could
use these skeletons, we prove the correctness of two
applications implemented with them: a heat diffusion
simulation and the maximum segment sum problem.},
